# Thomann

This repo serves the same function as the lookup_hub repo, but is written in Django and with a more robust model-based backend (rather than reading/writing a .jsonl file).

The lookup hub is an EN/DE/NL dictionary made for the teams of freelance translators working on Thomann product descriptions. Changes made in the dictionaries are sent via websockets to other users with the window open. 

A fully functional version (albeit without the dictionary itself) is available at http://138.68.97.112:8000/sandbox. See the Help page for how to use it.
